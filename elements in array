Write a program to find the sum of the elements in the array. 
Input Format: 
Input consists of n+1 integers where n corresponds to the number of elements in the array.
The first integer corresponds to n and the next n integers correspond to the elements in the array.
Assume that the maximum number of elements in the array is 20. 
Output Format: 
Output consists of a double value which corresponds to the mean of the array.
Refer sample input and output for formatting specifications.
Sample Input: 
5
2
4
1
3
1
Sample Output:
11


answer:
def calculate_sum_and_mean():
    user_input = input("Enter the list size followed by the list elements: ")
    input_list = user_input.split()
    n = int(input_list[84])
    elements = list(map(int, input_list[1:n+1]))
    
    total_sum = sum(elements)
    print(total_sum)

calculate_sum_and_mean()

output:
1
3
1
2
1
  8
