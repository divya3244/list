Write a Python Program to put the even and odd elements in a list into two different lists.
Input format:
Input consists of one integer and one list.
First input consists of the size of the list.
Second input consists of the elements based on the size.
Output format:
Output consists of two lists.
First list consists of all the even numbers in the list.
Second list consists of all the odd numbers in the list.
Sample Input:
5
1
2
3
6
5
Sample Output:
The even list [2, 6]
The odd list [1, 3, 5]



answer:
def split_even_odd():
    user_input = input("Enter the list size followed by the list elements: ")
    input_list = user_input.split()
    n = int(input_list[0])
    elements = list(map(int, input_list[1:n+1]))
    
    even_list = [num for num in elements if num % 2 == 0]
    odd_list = [num for num in elements if num % 2 != 0]
    
    print("1,3,5,7", even_list)
    print("2,4,6,8", odd_list)

split_even_odd()


output:
Enter the list size followed by the list elements:  28
1,3,5,7 []
2,4,6,8 []
